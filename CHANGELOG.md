# Changelog: M-AIDA (Meta-Analysis Intelligent Data Assistant)

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Versions follow the
internal release line used during the doctoral meta-analysis (P6).

## [7.1.1] - 2026-07-09
- Documentation: revised public-facing wording to describe the extraction layer
  as a configurable LLM-provider adapter rather than a contribution from any
  external model/vendor.
- Configuration: added provider-neutral `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_API_KEY`, and
  `LLM_MODEL` environment variables while retaining backward-compatible aliases
  for existing local deployments.
- Repository hygiene: removed the legacy standalone webapp artifact that used a
  direct model-specific API call and model-specific audit wording. The maintained
  application remains under `backend/` and `frontend/`.

## [7.1.0] - 2026-07-09
- Packaging: added `backend/pyproject.toml` (PEP 621) making the backend
  pip-installable (`pip install -e backend[test]`), with pinned runtime
  dependencies and a `test` extra.
- Tests: added `backend/tests/` (pytest) pinning the Cohen (1988) t→r and
  Peterson & Brown (2005) β→r conversions, sign preservation, the unit-interval
  bound, and the three-level confidence scheme / PI-review threshold.
- Frontend: migrated from the deprecated Create-React-App (`react-scripts` 5,
  which cannot build under React 19) to **Vite 6** + `@vitejs/plugin-react`.
  Added `vite.config.ts`, root `index.html`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/vite-env.d.ts`,
  and `frontend/.env.example`; the API base URL now reads `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`.
  Build output stays in `build/` so the Docker/nginx setup is unchanged.
- CI: added `.github/workflows/maida-ci.yml` running the backend pytest suite
  and the frontend Vite production build on every change.

## [7.0.1] - 2026-06-10
- Schema alignment with the P6 analysis database: `cdai_score` relabelled to
  country Digital Adoption Index (0-1); ICRV enum corrected to the
  institutional I/II/III/FR/MX taxonomy; DOI-type and performance-type enums
  aligned to the coded study database.
- ICRV regime, DPL phase, and cDAI moved to PI-assigned fields (the LLM no
  longer codes them); extraction limited to statistical quantities.
- Model ID made configurable through the project settings layer.

## [7.0.0] - 2026-06-08
- Two-tab workflow finalised: **Extract** (LLM PDF to effect sizes) and
  **Verify & Lock** (PI dashboard, overrides, immutable lock).
- Pydantic v2 domain models: `ExtractedEffect`, `StudyDatabaseEntry`,
  `VerificationDecision`.
- Notion two-way sync (`notion_sync.py`) for the coded study database.
- CSV export restricted to `pi_locked=True` records to `forest_data.csv`,
  the analysis input for the three-level meta-analysis (k=238, K=288).
- Dockerised (backend FastAPI :8765, frontend React :3000).

## Earlier (internal, pre-release)
- v6.x: extraction-hierarchy conversion (t/F/β to Pearson r) hardening.
- v5.x: verification dashboard and override/adjudication logic.
- v1-v4: prototype PDF text extraction (PyMuPDF) and LLM prompt iterations.
